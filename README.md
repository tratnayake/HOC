# Higher Order Components ( + React + Redux)

Important to note:

React - UI Manipulation
Redux -  State Manipulation

React-Redux = library that links the two together.

Redux: Application STATE is defined by REDUCERS.

React COMPONENTS take in PROPS through mapping the STATE to PROPS.

Components (or anything) can emit ACTIONS which change the state via REDUCERS.
